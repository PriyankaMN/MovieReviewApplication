•	Developed a movie application using a third-party "themoviedb.org" by reregistering the API key with the IMDB service, which gives a giant database of movies with the title and ratings.
•	JavaScript is used to fetch requests to get the data and show the most popular movies
•	The hover effect is used to show the overview of each movie.
•	Special color is used to specify the rating depending on what the rating is as per the below description:
•	If the rating is above eight, it'll be green.
•	If it's between five and eight, it'll be orange.
•	If it's below five, it'll be red.
•	search functionality is implemented: search for the word and I hit enter, it's going to get all the movies with the title/word.
