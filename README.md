•	Developed a movie application using a third-party "themoviedb.org" by reregistering the API key with the IMDB service, which gives a giant database of movies with the title and ratings.

•	JavaScript is used to fetch requests to get the data and show the most popular movies

•	The hover effect is used to show the overview of each movie.

•	Special color is used to specify the rating depending on what the rating is as per the below description:

        • If the rating is above eight, it'll be green.
    
        • If it's between five and eight, it'll be orange.
    
        • If it's below five, it'll be red.

•	search functionality is implemented: search for the word and I hit enter, it's going to get all the movies with the title/word.
